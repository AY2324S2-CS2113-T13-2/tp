## Project: Time Comparer

### Team: AY2324S2-CS2113-T13-2

Time Comparer is a desktop application used for time management between users.

This is a task scheduler and timetable comparison command line app that allows users to create timetables consisting of
task throughout a week. Each user has their own timetable, which can be compared to see shared time between
users. This makes it easy for people to schedule events based on their shared free time.
